# GDG Solution Challenge Project
Welcome to the repository for my submission to the Google Developer Groups on Campus Solution Challenge, powered by Hack2Skill. This project was created with the mission to address real-world challenges through the power of Artificial Intelligence and innovative thinking.

# ðŸš€ About the Project
This project was developed as part of the GDG Solution Challenge, focusing on solving the problem of Accelerating The Drug Discovery Using GEN AI.
The idea is to find the damaged molecule in the DNA, then find the alternate molecule than can fit in there and then replace the affected molecule.
